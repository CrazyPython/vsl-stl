# VSL Standard Library

The Standard Library for [VSL](github.com/vsl-lang/VSL),
currently developed independently of the interpreter.

The functions in this repository are agnostic of the
VSL language, since it is bound to change at any time
 \- *i.e.* to be developed as if it were a C++ library, like Boost.
